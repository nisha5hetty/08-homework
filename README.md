 PDF parsing

## **What the assignment was about:**
The assignment was about extracting tables from pdfs and cleaning the data.

## **Something I learned in the process:**
I learnt how to find a table by grabbing the coordinates. I didn't understand the point of this concept when it was mentioned in class, but realized its value after trying to extract tables without it and ending up with data that was all over the place, literally. I also learnt how to combine tables distributed across several pages into one table using 'concat' and how to remove rows with duplicate values.

## **Something I found challenging:**
Cleaning the data was challenging. You have to get rid of duplicate rows and even after you get rid of them, there could be other repeating values that need to be removed. There were just so many layers to it. I feel like if I don't use pandas for a few days, I completely forget it. I wish there was a way to make the information stick.
